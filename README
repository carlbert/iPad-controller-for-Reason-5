Project: iPad controller for Reason 5
Version: 1.0

===============================================

This is an interface to control some Reason 5 instruments, it«s based on OSCTouch (iPad app) and Osculator (Mac app), so basically you«ll need a copy of both applications and a copy of Propellerhead«s Reason 5 to use this.

This repository contains the OSCTouch file, the Osculator file and a Reason 5 file with all the controls mapped so you can use it as a template and start making music right away.

At this moment the interface works fine most of the time, but in recent tests in other computers sometimes the mapping isn't recognized. It's easy to fix that, you«ll only need to do your own mapping.
