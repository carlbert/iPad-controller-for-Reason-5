Project: iPad controller for Reason 5
Version: 1.0

===============================================

This is an interface to control some Reason 5 instruments, it«s based on OSCTouch (iPad app) and Osculator (Mac app), so basically you«ll need a copy of both applications and a copy of Propellerhead«s Reason 5 to use this.

The iPad interface will talk to the MIDI controls over a protocol called OSC, the repository contains an interface to use with an OSCTouch and a file with the OSC controls to use in the Mac with a software called OSCulator (http://www.osculator.net/), which translates the OSC signal generated by the iPad into MIDI signals to use with Reason 5. 

This repository also contains a Reason 5 file with all the controls mapped so you can use it as a template and start making music right away.

At this moment the interface works fine most of the time, but in recent tests in other computers sometimes the mapping isn't recognized. It's easy to fix that, you«ll only need to do your own mapping.
